				<p>
					If you do not renew your domain before its expiry date it may be suspended and we will not guarantee your
					renewal. If your domain is associated with other services which you do not renew in time it and your other
					services may be suspended, your domain may expire and we will not guarantee your renewal. Upon suspension of
					your domain name you will have up to 30 days (protected period) to enter a new agreement for services or (at
					our sole discretion) renew your previous agreement to renew the domain name. Please contact us via your normal
					point of contact for further information. After 30 days your domain will be suspended and will go into a 60
					day grace period during which you can still renew your domain name but there may be additional charges. If you
					have not entered into an agreement for the renewal of your domain name before the 80th day after your domain
					has expired your domain may be deleted from the register and made available for resale (including through
					third party registrars).
				</p>

				<p>
					Unless you have instructed us to the contrary; have made alternative arrangements with us; or we have an
					alternative method of operating with you, you will be notified in advance and given the opportunity to renew
					your domain name registration service. If we do not receive your renewal before the expiry of your service we
					may, at our sole discretion, attempt to contact you to seek your positive confirmation that you wish to allow
					your service to expire. It is your responsibility to renew your service prior to expiry
